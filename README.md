# How to Web Design

This is a presentation aimed at outlining best-practice web design for use by new designers, remote designers or design teams, or designers who struggle to work alongside front-end developers. I hope to keep it maintained with the latest best practices so would very much welcome feedback and contributions.

Happily accept pull requests.

## Contributing

Please submit a pull request with updates to the slides. We can discuss the merits of your changes in the comments thread for the pull request.

Things I'm really looking for are:
* translations
* content updates
* design improvements
* grammar, punctuation, and spelling fixes
